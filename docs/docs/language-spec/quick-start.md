# Quick Start

This is an example for a Hello World program that runs in our Explicit Control Evaluator.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt",
    "sync"
)

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

Package statements must be present but the package name is arbitrary, and will be ignored.

The function main must be present and it will get executed.
